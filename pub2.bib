abstract={Evaporation is a ubiquitous non-equilibrium phenomenon which plays a vital role in both micro and macro phase transition systems. Leading evaporation theories, such as the kinetic gas theory and the statistical rate theory, rely on the interfacial temperature data to predict the mass flux. Compared to water and other room temperature fluids, the interfacial temperature measurement for cryogenic fluids were seldom reported, which means the evaporation calculations at cryogenic temperatures have to use regular correlations or coefficients developed from non-cryogenic fluids. In the present study, a visualized and controlled evaporation system was designed and fabricated. Liquid oxygen was used as the testing fluid since it is the common oxidant of the cryogenic propellants. The temperature distributions in the interfacial regions of steady-state evaporating liquid oxygen were obtained at a set of mass flux and pressure. Temperature discontinuities up to 0.79 K were observed across the liquid–vapor interface of evaporating oxygen. It was found that the liquid was overheated. The measurement implied that the examined evaporation theories lose their accuracy in predicting mass flux rate and temperature jump at cryogenic temperatures by deviations on several orders of magnitude. A modified expression for the evaporation coefficient was provided which shows higher accuracy than early expressions especially in atmospheric pressure regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Liquid-vapor phase change models vitally influence the simulation of self-pressurization processes in closed containers. Popular liquid-vapor phase change models, such as the Hertz-Knudsen relation, energy jump model, and their derivations were developed based on room-temperature fluids. Although they had widely been applied in cryogenic simulations with liquid-vapor transitions, the performance of each model was not explicitly investigated and compared yet under cryogenic conditions. A unified multi-phase solver incorporating four typical liquid-vapor phase change models has been proposed in the present study, which enables direct comparison among those models against experimental data. A total number of 171 self-pressurization simulations were conducted to evaluate the evaporation and condensation models’ prediction accuracy and calculation speed. It was found that the pressure prediction highly depended on the model coefficients, whose optimization strategies differed from each other. The energy jump model was found inadequate for cryogenic self-pressurization simulations. According to the average deviation and CPU consumption, the Lee model and the Tanasawa model were proven to be more stable and more efficient than the others. © 2021},

abstract={Research question: Is vitrification with microinjection of single seminiferous tubules an efficient cryopreservation approach for limited testicular tissue? Design: Testicular tissue from 10 patients with normal spermatogenesis were assigned to a fresh control group or one of the following cryopreservation procedures: uncontrolled slow freezing (USF) using either 1.5 or 2.1 M DMSO combined with sucrose and vitrification with or without single seminiferous tubules microinjection. Results: Single seminiferous tubules microinjected with cryoprotective agents (CPA) enhanced the penetration of CPA compared with CPA-treated testicular tissue fragments. Microinjection of seminiferous tubules (VLP) maintained tubule structural integrity and germ cell numbers, and reduced spermatogonial apoptosis after cryopreservation compared with vitrification without microinjection (apoptosis rate: VLP versus vitrification without microinjection, P = 0.047; VLP versus USF, P= 0.049). Freezing of single seminiferous tubules using 0.25-ml straws and traditional sperm freezing methods protected sperm retrieval and recovery rates, and the progressive motility index. Conclusions: Vitrification of single seminiferous tubule with microinjection of low CPA concentration is an effective approach to testicular cryopreservation. © 2021},

abstract={Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) has been considered as a promising method for pressure control in cryogenic propellant tanks in microgravity environment. TVS could be operated in different modes, namely, the mixing-venting (MV) mode, the mixing-only (MO) mode, the mixing-only followed by mixing-venting (MOMV) mode, and the passive venting (PV) mode. An experimental investigation on the effect of operation mode on the TVS performance was conducted by using liquid nitrogen as the liquid oxygen simulant on a testing facility named Multi-functional Cryogenic Test System. Results of those four operating modes tests were compared regarding the ullage cooling effect, liquid temperature, pressure control capability, and mass loss. It was found that with the help of spraying, the MV mode and the MO mode cooled the ullage more effectively than the PV mode did. However, the PV mode is more effective in suppressing the increase of the liquid temperature. A non-dimensional parameter η has been proposed for comparison between the ullage heating and the liquid evaporation contribution to the pressurization in cryogenic fluid storage tanks. For the mixing-venting mode, the ullage heating is the main force that pressurizes the tank when the liquid is subcooled, while when the liquid is saturated, the evaporation takes over the role. Moreover, the MOMV mode performs the best in reducing mass loss within 0–1500 min. The results will be useful to make a control strategy for the operation of pressure control in on-orbit cryogenic tanks through thermodynamic venting method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The primary challenge for the long-term storage of cryogens in space is evaporation and consequent pressurization due to heat leakage. This study innovatively presents the scale effects on pressurization covering a wide range of tank volume from 6.37×10-3 to 208 m3, under normal gravity and microgravity. A computational fluid dynamic model based on the volume-of-fluid method is constructed to predict the thermodynamic behaviors in partially filled hydrogen tanks. The geometric scale is found to play a significant role in influencing the pressurization rate only for tanks in the small-scale range, especially under normal gravity. The pressurization rate is lower under microgravity than under normal gravity for small tanks. However, the opposite is observed when the tank size exceeds a critical value. An empirical correlation is originally presented to relate the real pressurization rate to the tank diameter and the pressurization rate based on homogeneous model. According to a thermodynamic analysis, the direct sensible energy input of vapor, the mass transfer on the liquid-vapor interface, and the liquid thermal expansion are the three causes of self-pressurization, which are all related to the geometric scale. The conclusions can be used for the pressurization prediction of various emissions in the aerospace applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The boil-off loss and self-pressurization have always been great concerns in the cryogen storage systems. Accurate prediction of the self-pressurization process in a cryogenic storage tank exposed to extremely low heat flux usually requires tremendous computational resources. General commercial computational fluid dynamic software is incompetent for pressure estimations lasting days or even months with regular hardware support. This paper proposed an optimized computational model for transient simulation of the self-pressurization process in cryogenic storage tanks based on the open source platform OpenFOAM. Ten times improvement in the calculation speed was achieved compared to the widely used commercial solvers, without compromising the accuracy. An optimal region was found and suggested for the evaporation and condensation coefficients. The commonly used “constant heat flux boundary” has been proved overestimating thermal stratification in the axial direction parallel to the tank wall. The model enables quick and accurate simulation for the long-term self-pressurization in cryogenic storage tanks applied in the industry for liquid hydrogen, liquefied natural gas, and liquid air products storage and deep space exploration programs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Cryopreservation of extremely few spermatozoa is still a major challenge for male fertility preservation. This study aims to evaluate the cooling rate, recovery rate, and retrieval rate, along with other parameters of spermatozoa that cryopreserved using Cryopiece, a novel carrier, for individual sperm cryopreservation. Methods: Semen samples from 60 fertile donors were collected, and each semen sample was screened for motile sperm and mixed with cryoprotective agent (CPA), and then frozen using Cryopiece, micro-straw, and mini-straws. The cooling rate, retrieval rate, and recovery rate, morphology, DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), were compared among the un-frozen sperm and the sperm cryopreserved using these carriers. Results: Cryopiece possessed the fastest cooling rate. After freeze-thaw, the average retrieval rate of sperm cryopreserved using Cryopiece was 96.25%, and the average recovery rate was 64.40%, which were higher than that of sperm cryopreserved using the other two carriers (71.42% and 54.30% for micro-straw, and 63.54% and 58.04% for mini-straw, respectively). There was no significant impact on DFI after sperm cryopreservation, and no significant difference in morphology between sperm cryopreserved using these carriers was observed. Though MMP of sperm changed significantly after cryopreservation, micro-straw maintained sperm MMP better than Cryopiece and mini-straw did, while no significant difference was observed in MMP between sperm cryopreserved using Cryopiece and mini-straw. Conclusions: Cryopiece produced satisfying retrieval and recovery rates in sperm cryopreservation and should be an ideal carrier for cryopreservation of small number of sperm. © Translational Andrology and Urology.

The pressure drop is quantified using an integrated form of the Forchheimer equation, where permeability is expressed as a function of screen parameters, including pore diameter, tortuosity, constriction factor, and porosity. Each parameter is determined solely from the pore-scale morphology of various weaves, and hence, the accurate expression for each screen is derived without introducing additional fitting constants. The results obtained using the proposed model are corroborated by 1500 + data points from existing literature with a mean absolute relative error of 23.0%, focusing on four types of typical wire screens—Plain Square, Twilled Square, Plain Dutch, and Dutch Twill—and both room-temperature and cryogenic fluids in the Reynolds number range of 0.1<Re<1000. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Liquid hydrogen has been identified as a promising propellant for long-duration space missions, benefiting from its high specific impulse when paired with liquid oxygen. A full procedural computational fluid dynamic model was proposed for the jetting, mixing, throttling, and venting processes of thermodynamic venting systems (TVS) for the purpose of minimizing liquid hydrogen boil-off on orbit. In addition to the mixing and jetting components as well as the fluid domain inside the storage tank, the external fluid circulation loop and the throttling device were also coupled into the solver in the form of user-defined code, which enabled simulation of the continuous complete thermodynamic cycles. The evaporation/condensation intensity factors for the liquid-vapor phase change were confined in a smaller range than those used in other studies through theoretical analysis. To enhance the numerical stability, the well-known Lee model for liquid-vapor phase change was modified by introducing a smoothing function. Simulations with a variety of initial temperatures, mass flow-rates and vent ratios were conducted, which revealed that the condensation of superheated vapor contributes to the depressurization processes noticeably greater than the disturbance of the temperature stratification. Depressurization efficiency was introduced for evaluating the TVS performance during the jetting process. Significant performance enhancement was observed when the temperature difference between the liquid and the ullage before jetting was enlarged. The self-pressurization period was found lasting longer time under on-orbit condition than that on the ground, which is attributable to the floating of the bulk liquid and higher uniformity of the temperature distribution after the jetting process in the absence of gravity. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

abstract={Due to the effect of surface tension, the process of fluid climbing along the inner wall at a certain angle in the microgravity environment is different from that of normal gravity. To study the physical process of capillary flow in microgravity, this paper uses the magnetic compensation method to set up a normal temperature magnetic fluid microgravity compensation experimental platform, which achieves magnetic compensation of less than 5% non-uniformity longitudinally in the target area. Visualized experimental research on the climb process of water-based magnetic fluid along the interior corner of different materials under the condition of different gravity is performed to verify the influence of contact angle and interior corner angle on the fluid transport capacity in the microgravity environment and to reveal the capillary flow law of the magnetic fluid in the microgravity environment. The results show that when the Concus-Finn condition is satisfied, the liquid surface climbing height and the gravity acceleration are approximately inversely proportional. The smaller the contact angle and interior corner angle, the stronger the fluid transport capacity of the material, especially in a good microgravity environment. When the Concus-Finn condition is not satisfied, the liquid surface climbing height and the acceleration of gravity have a linear relationship, and the impact of changes in contact angle and interior corner angle on the fluid transport capacity is not obvious. © 2020, Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd.

abstract={The long-term storage of cryogenic propellants on orbit under thermal and pressure control is a promising enabling technology for future space exploration. The combination of vapor cooled shield (VCS) and multilayer insulation (MLI) is considered as an effective passive thermal control method for such missions. To experimentally investigate the thermal insulation performance of VCS and MLI combination (MLI/VCS), a cryogen boil-off calorimeter system has been designed and fabricated. It is capable of measuring the heat flux through the VCS and MLI combination, as well as the temperature profiles both on the VCS and inside the MLI. The insulation effectiveness of MLI/VCS is evaluated with liquid nitrogen as the simulated cryogen in the warm-boundary temperature range from 200 K to 350 K. For the warm boundary temperature of 350K case, the insulation performance comparison between MLI/VCS and MLI only is conducted. In addition, the heat transfer behaviour within the insulation combination is discussed in detail. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A novel hybrid system, comprising a parabolic trough solar collector and solar photovoltaic/thermal collector units, is proposed and structured for useful multi-generational purposes with hydrogen production. The designed system comprises a parabolic trough solar collector for electricity generation, hydrogen production, and cooling applications. The solar photovoltaic/thermal collector modules serve the purposes of hydrogen production and space heating. A thermodynamic analysis was conducted for practical applications and implementation. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies of the system were calculated to be 12.90% and 54.72%, respectively, for a solar fluid exit temperature of 477 K. The hydrogen production could reach up to 8.226 g/s from the parabolic trough solar collector electrolyzer and 0.07518 g/s from the solar photovoltaic/thermal collector electrolyzer, which could be used for various useful domestic, medical, and industrial applications. The effects of varying the solar fluid exit temperature, incident solar irradiation, ambient temperature, and working fluids on the working system capability were examined. The proposed system demonstrated that the standalone solar hybrid system could serve as a vital tool for essential energy output purposes that are physically practical and economically viable. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The interface distribution and self-pressurization phenomenon are the most important problems in the storage of cryogenic liquid on orbit, which are difficult to be predicted and assessed exactly due to the complex non-equilibrium thermal behavior. In this paper, one 3-D CFD model based on volume of fluid (VOF) method is established to investigate the interface evolution and self-pressurization process in the liquid oxygen (LOX) tank in microgravity environment with various heat loads and gravitational accelerations. The validity of the model is verified by both the present ground experiments and the drop tower experiments from literature. The impact of microgravity on the gas-liquid interface distribution in the cryogenic tank is analyzed. Different from the ground condition, the distribution behavior of the gas-liquid two-phase fluid in microgravity is that the liquid is covering the tank wall, and the ullage is staying at the top of the tank surrounded by the liquid. Then the pressurization rate of the tank with different gravitational accelerations is obtained. The tank pressure rise rate increases with the reducing of the gravity. The results are beneficial to the optimal design of the cryogenic propellant tank. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

abstract={In order to investigate the pressure control behavior of cryogenic propellant tank and operating performance of thermodynamic vent system (TVS), a set of high-efficiency cryogenic fluid storage platform with liquid nitrogen as storage medium was set up, to simulate the pressure variations of liquid oxygen tank under the operation of TVS. The single variable control method was used to carry out the experimental research, which concentrate on the pressure control of TVS in a liquid nitrogen (LN2) tank with different throttle rates and modes. The pressure, temperature variations and vent mass loss of LN2 tank under different throttling parameters were analyzed. It was found that the duty rate of TVS decreases significantly with the increase of throttle rate, and the cooling capacity of the system is increased, which greatly reduces the TVS operating time. Based on the principle of reducing the working time and fluid mass loss, the optimal throttling ratio of TVS is obtained. On the other hand, the throttle opening has a remarkable influence on the cooling power of TVS, the large pressure difference helps to improve the cooling power. © All Right Reserved.},

abstract={Thermal stratification of cryogenic propellants under the condition of external heat leakage is a dominating factor pressurizing the storage tank, which hinders long-term on-orbit storage missions for future explorations. Whether a thermodynamic venting system or cryocooler is introduced to reduce the boil-off losses or even realize zero boil-off of the cryogens, an efficient mixing and heat-exchanging device is a prerequisite for eliminating thermal stratification. Usually, a subcooled stream is introduced, which is injected into the tank through the nozzles on a spray bar. Early research provided evidence that the cooling effect is related to the arrangement of the nozzles. In contrast to adopting a heavy plate spray bar to realize the temperature profile symmetry along the tank axis, this study proposes an assembly with a rotatable nozzle head to diminish the temperature non-uniformity in the tank. In this manner, over 70% of the spray bar payload can be saved compared to the plate configuration. A three-dimensional model was established to investigate the temperature distribution of liquid hydrogen at zero gravity in a tank containing such a rotatable sprayer, which was passively driven by the counterforce of the injection flow, and therefore excluded an extra power drive demand. The injection inlet velocity, as well as the length and quantity of the nozzle arms, were analyzed parametrically to optimize the destratification performance. By employing the self-spinning sprayer, the standard deviation of the temperature in the tank could be lowered, along with the benefits of a significant payload reduction and elimination of direct power input. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

abstract={Novel wicks made of micro/nanopillar array or carbon nanotube array have the advantages of superhigh capillary pressure and compact dimensions, which is attractive for applications like smartphones. However, much lower permeability becomes the dominant shortcoming compared to conventional wicking structures. This work presents an investigation of the effects of low-permeability wick on various aspects of the heat pipe performance, by assigning the permeability as the parametric control variable. The transient process as well as steady state have been numerically solved by an efficient heat pipe simulation tool LVHPM. Heat pipe performances with wicks covering a wide range of permeability have been studied in terms of the mass flow, temperature, and pressure influences. Calculation results showed that with decrease of the permeability, the growth of flow resistance in the wick is faster than the capillary pressure, resulting in lower capillary limit. Further, the effect of permeability on the coupled fluid flow and heat transfer inside the heat pipe was investigated, assuming that the heat load is within moderate range. The velocity was shown to be more evenly distributed for lower permeability, but the total mass flux was insensitive to it. Steady-state temperature distribution was weakly related to wick permeability, whereas the transient temperature presented stronger dependence with permeability, showing faster response at smaller permeability. During the transition of external heat loads, pressure drop inside the wick was found being established in a short time. © 2019 by Begell House, Inc.},

abstract={Freezing of water flowing through a small channel can be used as a nonintrusive flow control mechanism for microfluidic devices. However, such ice valves have longer response times compared to conventional microvalves. To control and reduce the response time, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the flow freezing process inside the channel. This study investigates freezing in pressure-driven water flow through a glass channel of 500 μm inner diameter using measurements of external channel wall temperature and flow rate synchronized with high-speed visualization. The effect of flow rate on the freezing process is investigated in terms of the external wall temperature, the growth duration of different ice modes, and the channel closing time. Freezing initiates as a thin layer of ice dendrites that grows along the inner wall and partially blocks the channel, followed by the formation and inward growth of a solid annular ice layer that leads to complete flow blockage and ultimate channel closure. A simplified analytical model is developed to determine the factors that govern the annular ice growth, and hence the channel closing time. For a given channel, the model predicts that the annular ice growth is driven purely by conduction due to the temperature difference between the outer channel wall and the equilibrium ice-water interface. The flow rate affects the initial temperature difference, and thereby has an indirect effect on the annular ice growth. Higher flow rates require a lower wall temperature to initiate ice nucleation and result in faster annular ice growth (and shorter closing times) than at lower flow rates. This study provides new insights into the freezing process in small channels and identifies the key factors governing the channel closing time at these small length scales commonly encountered in microfluidic ice valve applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The long-term storage of cryogenic propellants on orbit under thermal and pressure control is a promising enabling technology for future space exploration. Composite insulation composed of polyurethane foam (Foam), variable density multilayer insulation (VD-MLI), and a vapor-cooled shield (VCS) is considered as an effective passive thermal control method for such missions. This paper presents a theoretical model that considers three heat transfer mechanisms simultaneously within the VD-MLI and convective heat transfer inside the VCS, to predict and optimize the thermal performance of the insulation combination. The model is validated by experimental data. The influences of VCS position and warm boundary temperature (heat flux) on the thermal insulation performance are investigated for LH2, LN2, LO2, and LCH4 tanks. The temperature profiles within the insulation material with or without VCS are compared. In addition, the contributions from the VCS to reduce the heat flux into the tank are evaluated. The conclusions are valuable for the optimal design of future composite insulation with Foam/VCS/VD-MLI for cryogenic storage tanks on orbit. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) is deemed as an efficient pressure control technique for long-term on-orbit storage of cryogenic propellants through fluid mixing and a combination of throttling and heat exchanging before venting. To conduct further study on the performance of tank pressure control by TVS under non-uniform heat flux, the effect of non-uniform heat flux (vapor heating only, liquid heating only and one side wall heating for both vapor and liquid) on self-pressurization characteristics and mass loss has been investigated experimentally on a TVS simulator, which works at room temperature and with R141b as the working fluid. The tank pressure rising rate, TVS operation performance, and vent mass loss of different heating condition were compared in detail. The results showed that under the condition of vapor heating mode, the rising rate of the tank pressure is the fastest, the TVS operation frequency and vent mass loss are the highest. However, under the condition of liquid heating mode, the rising rate of the tank pressure is the slowest, the TVS operation frequency and vent mass loss are the lowest, which decreased by 42%, 29% and 33%, respectively, compared with the liquid heating mode. Considering the overall effect by the pressure rising rate, the thermal stratification of the fluid and the vent mass loss, the internal wall surface of the tank is better to have hydrophilic treatment or to integrate capillary structures to avoid direct heating of the ullage in micro-gravity environment. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology.

abstract={Controlling the pressure of a propellant tank while minimizing the propellant mass loss is the primary technical demand of cryogen storage missions in the reduced gravity environment in space. Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) has been considered as a potential solution for this issue. Before conducting studies on TVS-equipped cryogen storage technology in space and on the ground, a TVS unit at room temperature with refrigerant R141b as the substituting phase-changing fluid was designed and tested. The performance of the TVS was evaluated at different combinations of the operation parameters including the fill level (35%, 50%, 65%), heat load (74.7 W, 108.8 W, 148.4 W), and control strategies. Mass loss, which is an unavoidable result of tank pressure control, was quantitatively compared between the TVS method and the direct gas vent method over a given period of time. Taking the heat load of 74.7 W as an example, the results showed that the mass loss can be reduced by as much as 79.3%. Assuming the vented stream contains 40% mass fraction of liquid if vented directly at zero-gravity, TVS can not only control the tank pressure within a designated range but also significantly help to reduce the mass loss. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and IIR},

abstract={Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays exhibit distinct wetting characteristics. Thus, they are a promising solution for many applications such as heat-pipe wicks. In this study, the dynamic behavior of liquid-droplet spreading via capillary action in a vertically aligned CNT array has been investigated experimentally and theoretically. Two groups of CNT array with heights of 150 μm and 250 μm were tested. Two organic solvents, namely ethanol and acetone, were selected as the wetting liquids because of their good wettability with the as-grown CNTs. A visualization system equipped with a high-speed camera was used to record the capillary-spreading process. The results of the CNT array with different array heights showed two distinct modes of spreading: a steady uniform mode and an unsteady random mode. In the unsteady mode, the liquid predominantly spreads above the array. In the steady mode, the spreading process can be divided into three phases based on the different dominating effects. After the first flooding phase, the spreading in the second phase was found to follow the Lucas–Washburn model, whereas the third phase can be described using a constant evaporation-rate model. The self-assembly behavior was observed using an SEM after the wetting experiments. Honeycomb-shaped microstructures were formed spontaneously in the precursor-film region, whereas striped lines were observed on the front end of the contact line. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To further discover the flow resistance characteristics of liquid nitrogen in bellows in wider application range, dimensionless variables namely the ratio of wave-height over bellows-diameter (e/d) and the ratio of wave-pitch over wave-height (p/e) are introduced. CFD modeling has been conducted on the behaviors of both pressure drop and Darcy friction factor (f) at different geometries of the bellows, either with or without an insert. Effects on the f by different Reynolds numbers at certain ratios e/d or p/e in wide ranges were investigated. The results shows that the vortex forming inside the bellows trough is the main cause of the flow resistance increment. When the e/d and p/e remain unchanged, changing of the inner diameter of the bellows has little influence on the friction factor. If a rod is inserted into the bellows, the larger the rod diameter, the smaller the Darcy friction factor. When the diameter of the insert reduces to zero, the friction factor approaches that of the hollow bellows, which is consistent with the experimental results. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of Harbin Institute of Technology.

abstract={Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) is deemed as an efficient pressure control technique for long-term on-orbit storage of cryogenic propellants through fluid mixing and a combination of throttling and heat exchanging before venting. Three control strategies have been proposed to automate the mixing mode and venting mode of the TVS. The effects of these control strategies on liquid temperature, stratification and mass loss are investigated on a TVS simulator, which works at room temperature with R141b as the working fluid. The results show that the TVS can not only achieve a significant vent loss but also lower liquid temperatures and weaker stratification when one of the strategies is applied whose mixing mode operates based on ullage pressure and the vent mode is controlled based on both the ullage pressure and the bulk liquid temperature. This investigation provides guidance for the design and operation of cryogenic TVS. © All Right Reserved.},

abstract={Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) is employed for pressure control of propellant tanks at zero gravity. An analytical lumped parameter model is developed to predict pressure variation in an 18.09 m3 liquid hydrogen tank equipped with TVS. Mathematical simulations are carried out assuming tank is filled up to 75% volume (liquid mass equals to 945 kg) and is subjected to heat flux of 0.76 W/m2. Tank pressure controls at 165.5-172.4, 165.5-179.3 and 165.5-182.2 kPa are compared with reference to number of vent cycles, vent duration per cycle and loss of hydrogen. Analysis results indicate that the number of vent cycles significantly decreases from 62 to 21 when tank pressure control increases from 6.9 to 20.4 kPa. Also, duration of vent cycle increases from 63 to 152 and cycle duration decreases from 3920 to 3200 s. Further, the analysis result suggests that LH2 evaporation loss per day decreases from 0.17 to 0.14%. Based on the results of analysis, TVS is found effective in controlling the propellant tank pressure in zero gravity. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A numerical model based on an analytical lumped vapor assumption was proposed for highly efficient simulation of transient performances of heat pipes. The wick is modeled as fully thawed porous medium in which both the Darcian and non-Darcian effects are considered. The evaporation and condensation rates of the working substance are calculated locally as a function of not only the liquid–vapor interface temperature but also the vapor state properties by the kinetic theory. The coupled equations for liquid flow and heat conduction in/between components of the heat pipe are solved by a thermal lattice Boltzmann algorithm. Validation of the model is conducted by reproducing representative cases from the literature and then comparing the present results with their experimental and theoretical data. It turns out that both the transient temperature variation and the steady-state temperature and pressure profiles are in accordance with the literature results. The vapor velocity profile inferred from the evaporation rates is also found to be sufficiently accurate, which even gives a more reasonable estimate than the reference in comparison. In order to further improve the simulation efficiency of the code, non-uniform lattice and parallel algorithm are incorporated, based upon which the lumped vapor model achieves a speed over 50 times faster than the plain model with complete vapor consideration. The present model could serve as an efficient tool for quick evaluation of transient heat pipe behaviors and for assisting parametric studies of heat pipes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The performance of the thermodynamic vent systems (TVS) is significantly influenced by the operating parameters, initial condition, and geometry of the tank. This paper presents an experimental investigation on the effects of operating parameters on liquid nitrogen tank pressure control including different throttling modes and control strategies. Two control strategies were implemented experimentally on a TVS-equipped LN2 tank. The first strategy involves starting the pump and vent valve simultaneously once the ullage pressure increases to the upper limit of the control band. The second strategy involves operating the pump based on the ullage pressure, while the vent valve is controlled based on both the ullage pressure and bulk-liquid temperature. The results showed that the pressure-drop rate under the gas–liquid throttling mode was found to be approximately 1.95 times higher than that under the liquid-only throttling mode. The temperature increase rates of the ullage and liquid in the first strategy are slightly slower than those in the second strategy, whereas the average mass lost in the first strategy is approximately 3.25 times that in the second strategy for the same operation time. In addition, the effect of a noncondensable gas on the TVS performance was comparatively investigated. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Long-term storage of cryogenic propellants on orbit as the replenishing fuel for spacecraft and energy supply source for space station is a crucial part of future space exploration. Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) was proposed as an effective technology to maintain the propellant tank pressure and reduce the mass loss of liquid propellant. This study presents an experimental investigation on the pressure control effect of a TVS installed in a 1.36 m3 liquid nitrogen (LN2) tank of the testing facility named Efficient Cryogenic Fluid Storage Test Platform (ECFSTP). Two operation modes, namely the mixing-only mode and the mixing-venting mode of TVS were compared and analyzed. The degree of superheat of the ullage dropped more rapidly and significantly under the mixing-venting mode, which produces the cooling effect by the venting stream from the throttling valve in addition to venting itself. The effects of different pressure control bands on the performance of the TVS have also been comparatively investigated. The results confirmed the feasibility and effectiveness of the TVS to control the tank pressure within the range of 220–260 kPa for long time running, with 50% fill level and 9.31 W m−2 leaking heat flux. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The heat transfer capability of conventional materials like copper or devices like heat pipes are challenged by the growing trend of miniaturization of integrated circuit and exponentially increasing density of heat generation. Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) array has been recognized as a promising wicking structure of new generation heat pipes for higher heat transfer capability and more compact size. In contrast to conventional grooved or powder-sintered wicks, the CNT wick behaves differently due to the scale effects, which has been investigated through physical models extracted from its working conditions. The influence by the velocity slip of the liquid at the CNT wall is evaluated, which shows that the slip leads to considerable enhancement of the flow near the CNT wall. Calculation of the overall flow resistance indicates higher permeability due to the slip. The gaps between CNTs create exceptionally high capillary pressure due to the nanoscale pores. It proves to be apparently superior to conventional structures in micrometer scale. The effective thermal conductance of the CNT wick benefits from the extremely high thermal conductivity of CNTs thanks to the non-Fourier conduction. The effects emerged in the non-evaporating and thin-film regions are analyzed, which clearly shows that the evaporation at the liquid-vapor interface is dramatically affected by these nanoscale effects. The present study on scale effects identifies the advantages of the CNT wick in capillary ability, effective conductivity, and evaporative flux, etc. Meanwhile, it also reveals the disadvantage of relatively lower dry-out limit of the CNT wick. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

A generalized layer by layer model has been proposed to predict the thermal performance of the “Foam - Variable Density Multilayer Insulation combination” (FMLI) at different vacuum levels. A cryogen boil-off calorimeter system was designed and fabricated to measure the temperature profile and the apparent thermal conductivity of FMLI samples over a wide range of vacuum level (10−3- 105 Pa). The experimental data verified the validity of the model and indicated that the heat fluxes through the FMLI and the single VDMLI almost made no difference in vacuum of 10−3 Pa, which were both equal to 0.23 W·m−2with the boundary temperatures of 77 and 293 K, respectively. However, at the atmosphere level of 105 Pa, the heat fluxes through the FMLI and the single VDMLI significantly differed from each other and exacerbated to 45.2 and 147.8 W·m−2, respectively. In addition, a comparison between FMLI and Aerogel-MLI was also conducted for the same thickness and weight of VDMLI and at the same boundary temperatures and vacuum levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Cryogenic propellant storage on orbit is a crucial part of future space exploration. Efficient and reliable thermal insulation is one of the dominant technologies for the long-duration missions. This paper presents theoretical and experimental investigation on the thermal performance of variable density multilayer insulation (VDMLI) with different configurations and spacers. A practical method for optimizing the configuration of VDMLI was proposed by iteratively predicting the internal temperature profiles and maximizing the thermal resistance based on the basic layer by layer model. A cryogen boil-off calorimeter system was designed and fabricated to measure the temperature profile and effective heat transfer coefficient of the VDMLI samples over a wide range of temperature (77–353 K). The experimental data confirm that the optimized sample as predicted does have the minimum effective heat transfer coefficient in the control group. The results indicated that the insulation performance of MLI could be improved by 45.5% after replacing the regular uniform configuration with the optimized variable density configuration. For the same optimized configuration, the performance was further improved by 54% by changing the spacing material from none-woven fiber cloth to Dacron net. It was also found that the effective heat transfer coefficient will be much less sensitive to the MLI thickness when it exceeds 30 mm for on-orbit thermal environment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In order to study the fundamental problems involved in the storage of cryogens in space, the experimental investigation of tank pressure control was carried out on a simulator of thermodynamic vent system (TVS), which works at room temperature with refrigerant R141b as working fluid. The pressure control characteristics were obtained at heat load of 120, 160 and 200 W. The test results showed that the self-pressurization rate were 6.43, 12.92 and 18.05 kPa·h-1 respectively at those three different heat load. Mass loss as a result of tank pressure control was compared between TVS method and direct gas vent method. Taking the heat load of 120 W as an example, the mass loss can be reduced by 79.3%. Assuming the mixture vented directly at zero-gravity containing 40% liquid, the TVS method can reduce the mass loss even by up to 84.7%. It was proved that the TVS method cannot only control the tank pressure but also significantly reduce the loss of the storage fluid. © All Right Reserved.},

The engine was reversely operated as a refrigerator without any modification, and its cooling performance was measured at different input power. The results indicate that, a none-load cooling temperature 142.4 K was obtained at a maximum power supply voltage of 300 VAC (50 Hz), and 193.1 K was reached at a minimum input power of 60 VAC (50 Hz).

abstract={Adding thin compartmental plates near the internal walls of enclosures has been numerically modeled using the lattice Boltzmann method. This practice was found to be an effective way to further suppress the disadvantageous effects of heat leak, along with the application of insulation materials on the external surfaces. A modified extrapolation scheme for handling the thermal boundary of the thin plate was proposed and verified by comparison with the conventional coupled boundary scheme. The simulation of the natural convection during the cooling down processes and at steady states in the enclosure indicates that the existence of the plates leads to a higher cooling rate and a more favorable temperature uniformity. For a typical case, the one with plates takes 6% less time to reach the halfway point of the steady state and has 26% less temperature variance. Effects by the plates’ positions and sizes were parametrically investigated, in order to find an optimal geometrical configuration. In addition, the fluid’s intrinsic characteristics and the relative heat leak by using the Rayleigh number and Nusselt number, respectively, have been discussed in detail through hydrodynamic and convective heat transfer analyses. © 2016, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Cases where liquid has infiltrated such pillar arrays completely are drawing increased attention in miniaturized systems. An equivalent surface tension model is proposed to characterize the driving force of liquid evolution in patterned micro-pillar arrays after the Young-Laplace equation and surface energy analysis are applied on both the pillar unit and bulk liquid levels. The effects of local menisci induced from the wetting of pillars are bounded and treated as “equivalent liquid-vapor surface tension”, through which the bulk liquid profile is then obtained based on the principle of minimal surface energy. The model is found to be computationally efficient and can be easily obtained through numerical methods. A typical sample case is presented to demonstrate its advantages and simplicity. The bulk profile that considers the effects of pillar array is compared with the result without pillars.

abstract={Cryopreservation of few spermatozoa is still a major challenge for male fertility preservation. This study reports use a new micro-straw (LSL straw) for freezing few spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Semen samples from 22 fertile donors were collected, and each semen sample was diluted and mixed with cryoprotectant in a ratio of 1:1, and then frozen using three different straws such as LSL straw (50-100 μl), traditional 0.25 ml and 0.5 ml straws. For freezing, all straws were fumigated with liquid nitrogen, with temperature directly reducing to-130-140°C. Sperm concentration, progressive motility, morphology, acrosome integrity, and DNA fragmentation index were evaluated before and after freezing. After freezing-thawing, LSL straw group had significantly higher percentage of sperm motility than traditional 0.25 ml and 0.5 ml straw groups (38.5% vs 27.4% and 25.6%, P < 0.003). Sperm motility and acrosomal integrity after freezing-thawing were significantly lower than that of before freezing. However, there was no significant difference in morphology, acrosome, and DNA integrity between the three types of straws (P > 0.05). As LSL straws were thinner and hold very small volume, the freezing rate of LSL straw was obviously faster than 0.25 ml straw and 0.5 ml straws. In conclusion, LSL micro-straws may be useful to store few motile spermatozoa with good recovery of motility for patients undergoing ICSI treatment. © 2016 AJA, SIMM & SJTU. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Static electricity can be generated at the interface between a fluid and a solid surface. Hydrocarbon products as well as liquid hydrogen in chemical and energy industry are of low conductivity, inflammable and explosive, which enables the static charge easily accumulated, resulting in high electric potentials and electric fields during its transportation and storage. To avoid safety hazard due to sparks of sufficient energy for an explosion to occur inside a tank, this paper studied the formation and distribution of electrical potential of some typical hydrocarbon products and liquid hydrogen in cylindrical vessels. Poisson equation and Laplace equation were solved by using Bessel function to get the potential value distribution of liquid and gas in the tanks. The impact parameters such as tank structure, fluid properties and charge density to the potential were analyzed. The potential variation behavior against the above parameters was obtained. It was found that the maximum static potential appears at about 72% of the liquid level/height from the bottom instead of the liquid-gas interface. The calculations also showed that the potential reaches its crest value for each fluid studied when the filling rate is 65%-75% of the full capacity. Some suggestions were given for design of low conductivity fluid tanks to avoid high electric potential safety hazard. © All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Experimental results reported in the last decade on the thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown a fairly divergent behavior. An underlying intrinsic consistency was believed to exist in spite of the divergence in the thermal conductivity data of various CNTs. A dimenisonless equation that describes the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity was derived by introducing reduced forms relative to a chosen reference point. This equation can serve as a practical approximation to characterize the conductivity of individual CNT with different structural parameters as well as bulk CNT arrays with different bundle configurations. Comparison of predictions by the equation and historical measurements showed good agreements within their uncertainties. © 2014 Author(s).},

abstract={Temperature control around 20 K with a tolerance of better than 1 mili-Kelvin is challenging but essential for applications like cooling deuterium/tritium target in fusion ignition experiments. To explore the practicability of cryogenic temperature control on this level with a cryocooler as the cold source instead of a cryogen bath, experimental investigations were conducted to approach the best performance by optimizing configurations of effective measures. A special heat sink was fabricated and attached to the second-stage cold head of a G-M cryocooler which could reach temperatures down to 2.5 K and provide 13 W cooling power at 18 K. A thermal reservoir and/or temperature transmission damping were incorporated, as well as a manganin resistance wire electrical heater attached to the heat sink. Experimental results show that an optimal stability of the temperature of the shielded heat sink within ±0.4 mK at 20 K was achieved by choosing proper excitation for the sensors, control mode for the heater and capacity for the thermal reservoir. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Operating parameters, such as average pressure, pressure ratio, and warm-end temperature were varied to investigate the effect of non-ideal gas properties. Regenerator parameters such as matrix material and shape, hydraulic diameter, and regenerator geometry were varied to investigate losses due to non-ideal regenerator behavior. The results show that He-3 can increase the regenerator efficiency by a factor of at least two compared to a regenerator optimized for He-4. A layered regenerator of gadolinium oxysulfate (GOS) at the cold end and ErPr at the warm end is the best of many material combinations. A regenerator with parallel holes of about 20% porosity showed only slight improvement over one with packed spheres. The regenerator warm-end temperature has little effect on its efficiency for temperatures below 35 K and pressures of 1.0 MPa and above. An optimized 4 K He-3 regenerator uses layered GOS and ErPr with the warm end at about 30 K and an average pressure of about 1.0 MPa. With those optimum conditions a reduced regenerator loss of 0.36 and a regenerator second law efficiency of 25% are achieved. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={As a standard property of helium-3, the surface tension is not only an important aspect to study the normal characteristics of this special cryogenic fluid, but also helpful to understand the Fermi quantum effects at low temperatures. After completion of studies on the thermodynamic and two typical transport properties (thermal conductivity and viscosity) of helium-3, all of the published experimental data of the surface tension of 3He have been collected. Different measurement techniques are compared and analyzed. The peculiar behavior of 3He surface tension, perhaps dominated by Fermi-Dirac quantum statistics, is analyzed and discussed at temperatures starting from zero to its critical point (3.3157 K). Based on a regular theoretical model for surface tension, a semi-empirical correlation is proposed for 3He covering the whole temperature range. The surface tension extrapolated to zero temperature by this equation is 1.5579×10 -4 N • m -1. In the vicinity of the critical point, the equation could be smoothly switched to the known scaling law, which takes the critical index 1.289. Comparison for the surface-tension behavior is performed between 3He and its isotope 4He, which obeys Bose-Einstein statistics. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The helium-4 working fluid in regenerative cryocoolers operating with the cold end near 4 K deviates considerably from an ideal gas. As a result, losses in the regenerator, given by the time-averaged enthalpy flux, are increased and are strong functions of the operating pressure and temperature. Helium-3, with its lower boiling point, behaves somewhat closer to an ideal gas in this low temperature range and can reduce the losses in 4 K regenerators. An analytical model is used to find the fluid properties that strongly influence the regenerator losses as well as the gross refrigeration power. The thermodynamic and transport properties of helium-3 were incorporated into the latest NIST regenerator numerical model, known as REGEN3.3, which was used to model regenerator performance with either helium-4 or helium-3. With this model we show how the use of helium-3 in place of helium-4 can improve the performance of 4 K regenerative cryocoolers. The effects of operating pressure, warm-end temperature, and frequency on regenerators with helium-4 and helium-3 are investigated and compared. The results are used to find optimum operating conditions. The frequency range investigated varies from 1 Hz to 30 Hz, with particular emphasis on higher frequencies. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={A saturation vapor pressure equation, p(T), is an essential component in the 3He state equation currently under development. The state equation is valid over the range 0.01-20 K with pressures from 0 to the melting pressure or 15 MPa. The vapor pressure equation consequently must be valid from 0.01 K to the critical temperature. This paper surveys available 3He critical temperature and pressure measurements, leading to new recommended critical values of 3.3157 K and 114603.91 Pa. The ITS-90 temperature scale is defined by the 3He vapor pressure from 0.65 to 3.2 K. A new vapor pressure equation is developed for the interval from the upper end of the T90 scale to this newly defined critical point, employing a mathematical form in which the second derivative d2p/dT2 diverges in agreement with scaling laws at the critical point. Below 0.65 K, an empirical vapor pressure expression is adopted, consistent with a theoretical expression valid in the limit T → 0. These two new components are fitted to be piecewise continuous with the EPT-76 p(T) scale rather than the ITS-90 T(p) scale between 0.65 and 3.2 K. Probable deviations between this vapor pressure scale and PLTS-2000 melting pressure-temperature scale are recognized, but not reconciled. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This nonsegment equation, in SI unit, precisely describes the pressure and temperature relation along the melting curve of 3He at temperatures from 0.001 K to 30 K. The maximum and the average differences between calculations by the melting pressure equation and 406 measurements are 3.02% and 0.106%, respectively.

abstract={A novel gas-phase inlet configuration in the natural circulation system instead of the liquid-phase inlet is introduced to cool down a cryogenic pump system from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures, effectively. The experimental apparatus is illustrated and test process is described. Heat transfer and pressure drop data during the cool-down process are recorded and portrayed. By contrast with liquid-phase inlet configuration, experimental results demonstrate that the natural circulation with the gas-phase inlet configuration is an easier and more controllable way to cool down the pump system and maintain it at cryogenic temperatures. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Frequency matching is of great importance to a thermoacoustically driven pulse tube refrigeration system. To compute the resonance frequency of thermoacoustic engines, the fluid impedance method is introduced. The calculations of the thermoacoustic engines with different arrangements of buffer have been carried out. The influence of the buffer arrangements and the volume on the resonance frequency as well as the acoustic power of thermoacoustic engines is also discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
